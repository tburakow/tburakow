# About me:

An art conservator switching careers into coding. Currently studying @ [Hive helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) and looking for an internship/junior developer position.  
My interest in problem solving is what drove me to choose the alrithm branch in my studies and still drives my studies.
I'm an avid reader and enjoy working out in my spare time.

## About Hive Helsinki

"Hive is a new kind of coding school in Helsinki, based on the revolutionary education model of the French school Ecole 42.

Founded in 2013 by tech entrepreneur and visionary Xavier Niel, 42 disrupted education by building a school without the traditional teacher-student model, focusing on peer-to-peer collaboration, problem-solving and creativity. The impressive results (100% of graduates well-employed, 50% of which had no coding experience) have inspired others around the world to replicate the model with success. In July 2019, we opened our doors in Finland and were the first school of our kind in the Nordics"

## Studying at Hive Helsinki (my experience)

As Hive Helsinki is not a traditional coding school, but instead relies on peer-to-peer learning and projects for learning, forcing a hands-on approach from the very beginning.

Most of the coding I do in Hive is done in C. Additionally, we are only allowed to use very few library functions in the implementation of our projects. To name a few : write, malloc, free. All other we have had to write ourselves.

This has taught me to not rely on opaque libraries to perform the tasks, and instead to approach the problems in a very thorough manner. 

Hive's peer-to-peer approach has taught me to both ask for help when I'm stuck, and to be more ready to help others when i found them struggling. Rubberducking is effective!
